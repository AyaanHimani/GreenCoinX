# üåø Blockchain-Based Green Hydrogen Credit System

A proof-of-concept system for creating a transparent and verifiable digital lifecycle for green hydrogen credits using blockchain technology.

## üìú Overview

This project introduces a robust framework for tracking green hydrogen from production to retirement. The core of the system is to ensure that every unit of hydrogen is verifiably "green" and that the associated environmental credits are unique, transparent, and non-fungible.

By integrating **IPFS** for decentralized data storage and **Polygon blockchain** for smart contract execution, the system creates an immutable and auditable trail. This process enhances trust among producers, buyers, and regulators, aiming to build a more reliable and efficient green energy marketplace.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Digital Lifecycle Tracking:** Monitors every kilogram of green hydrogen from its creation, certification, sale, and final usage.
-   **Immutable Data Storage:** Production data from IoT devices is uploaded to **IPFS**, ensuring data integrity and tamper-resistance.
-   **Smart Contract Automation:** Credits are minted and managed as tokens on the **Polygon** blockchain, automating transfers and preventing double-spending.
-   **Producer Dashboard:** A web interface for producers to monitor their real-time production data and manage their minted credits.
